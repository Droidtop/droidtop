/**
 * Handed to {@link IPluginRuntime#registerCallback} so a plugin process
 * can report a crash back to :app without :app having to poll.
 * This is the other half of PluginCrashPolicy's containment: the binder
 * DeathRecipient catches the process dying outright, this callback
 * catches a plugin that threw but left the process alive.
 *
 * PluginRuntimeService now broadcasts every notification to EVERY
 * currently registered callback (a RemoteCallbackList), not just one --
 * see registerCallback's own doc comment for the bug this replaced. A
 * receiver whose own connection is dedicated to one job (PluginJobsCenter's
 * normal shape) will get other jobs' onJobProgress/onJobComplete calls
 * too and is expected to filter by the jobId it already knows about.
